# Static Contact Page with Form Using HTML, CSS, and React

Welcome to my static contact page with a form project! In this repository, I've created a simple web application that allows users to submit contact information using HTML, CSS, and React. Below, I'll provide you with an overview of the project.

## Project Overview

This project is a static web page that serves as a contact page with a submission form. It demonstrates my ability to create a user-friendly form interface using the following technologies:

- **HTML:** Used to structure the content of the webpage, including the form elements.
- **CSS:** Applied for styling and layout design, making the page visually appealing.
- **JavaScript** Employed for interactivity.
- **React:** Incorporated to enhance the user interface and provide a dynamic experience.

## Features

- A clean and visually appealing user interface with a contact form.
- Utilizes React components to create a dynamic form and enhance the user experience.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point of the application.
- `public/`: This directory may contain any static assets like images, fonts, or additional resources.
- `src/`: Here you'll find the JavaScript files for the React components, along with the CSS for styling.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- React

## Usage

To view and interact with this static contact page, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can submit contact information through the form, and React will handle the dynamic aspects of the form interface.

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to the open-source community and the numerous online resources that helped me develop this project.
